## Suggestions to improve

- divide the entire project into smaller component, make separate branches and manage all the tickets/ branches in jira board/trello/github projects
- storybook
- we can implement a database where we can store email of the users, and later on, we can use those emails to promote the company.
- we can separate the reusable enums and interfaces to a separate folder.
- we can dockerize the application and deploy it to a server.
- we can implement a local storage / session storage for the application so that the user can revisit the page and check their card application status
- a loading component
- a error component
