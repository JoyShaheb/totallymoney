## outcome?

This project is polised and complete as of September 18th, 2023. I am happy with the outcome and I am looking forward to improve it in the future.

## Project Setup

* npx create-react-app . --template typescript
* npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
* npm install react-hook-form
* npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
* npm i json-server react-router-dom
* npm i dayjs

## Suggestions to improve

* divide the entire project into smaller component, make separate branches and manage all the tickets/ branches in jira board/trello/github projects
* storybook
* we can implement a database where we can store email of the users, and later on, we can use those emails to promote the company.
* we can dockerize the application and deploy it to a server.

## make it better

* eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged, pre-commit
* âœ… redux-perist
* add react-toastify
* reset button for the form, and make it work
